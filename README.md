A guide and starting files for running a Minecraft server on a Raspberry Pi 5 using Purpur, GNU Screen* and some scripts. At the end of this guide, you should have a Raspberry Pi that will launch a GNU Screen session on reboot. That Screen session will display the server output, current RAM/CPU usage and a blank terminal. You will then be able to remotely access the Screen session using SSH from any other computer on the network. 

\* Technically it's just called Screen, but trying to Google for that is one of Dante's Circles.
## Required materials
* Raspberry Pi 5 (other models may work, but RAM may be a limiting factor). I purchased the [Complete Kit from Vilros for $150](https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-5?variant=40082990399582).
  * Additional hardware for the Pim including:
    * Power supply
    * Case with active cooling
    * Mouse + keyboard with USB A
    * microSD for the Pi's storage
      * A method to program the SD
    * Micro HDMI to [HDMI/DVI/other] cable
* Some basic knowledge of: (recommended, but this is a good way to learn!)
  * Linux command line
  * Vim
* A main computer for remotely accessing the Pi (completely optional, but you will not be able to play Minecraft on the Pi)
